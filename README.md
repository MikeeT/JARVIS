# JARVIS
This program is designed to be an assistant, like Siri on Apple, and Cortana on windows. However, JARVIS is going to be more oriented in helping complete tasks, and handle background applications. Currently JARVIS is only able 
 	
 1) Compute simple math functions
  
  2) open directories to applications on the computer and run them
  
  3) create a new directory to an application to run it
  
  4) open websites


Later i plan on adding the FreeTTS library to the project in order to give JARVIS a voice. Currently JARVIS only accepts commands inputed through a textbox, later i plan on making it so that voice commands are also accepted.

To Run the program place all the files into a folder labeled JARVIS, and make that the main module for the program. Put the src folder as the source root and call main.java. This will start the application and run the JavaFX GUI.
